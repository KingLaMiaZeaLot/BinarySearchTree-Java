# Binary Search Tree in Java

This project is a simple and clean implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java. It includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and tree traversals.

## 📌 Features

- Insert nodes into the BST
- Delete nodes from the BST
- Search for a value
- Find minimum and maximum values
- Inorder traversal
- Preorder traversal
- Postorder traversal

## 📁 Project Structure
bst/
├── Node.java // Node structure for the BST
├── BST.java // BST operations
└── MainBST.java // Driver class with example usage


## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BinarySearchTree-Java.git
2. cd BinarySearchTree-Java
3. javac bst/*.java
4. java bst.MainBST


##📌 Sample Output
Inorder: 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 
Preorder: 50 30 20 40 70 60 80 
Postorder: 20 40 30 60 80 70 50 
Min: 20
Max: 80
Inorder after delete: 20 30 40 60 70 80
